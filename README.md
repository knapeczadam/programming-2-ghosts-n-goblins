# 🩲 Programming 2 – Ghosts 'n Goblins  

Hey there, fellow DAE student, arcade fan, or curious visitor 👋  
Welcome to my **Programming 2 – Ghosts 'n Goblins** repository — a final project building on the [Programming 2](https://github.com/knapeczadam/programming-2) course.

---

## 🗄️ About this repository

This repo contains my **arcade game remake project**, recreating the **first level of Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins (1985)**.  

The main goal was to **apply object-oriented programming (OOP)** and leverage all the knowledge acquired during **Programming 2**.  
Pixel-perfect implementation ensures accurate recreation of the level, while the debug build adds **infinite lives** and visualizes **sprites and physics/logical points** for testing purposes.

> ⚠️ Note: this project is part of the learning process, not a production-ready game.  
> Consider it a **snapshot of my Programming 2 final project**.
